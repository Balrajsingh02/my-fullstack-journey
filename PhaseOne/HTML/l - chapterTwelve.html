    <p>
      Based on
      <strong><span title="Product Requirement Document">PRD</span></strong
      >, develop a website in pure HTML. Currently you have just HTML skils and
      you can develop a product based on that skills only. Figure out, how much
      time it takes to develop a PRD and prepare an HTML based website along
      with content.
