  <body>
    <p>
      My name is Balraj Singh, and I’m on a journey to become a top-tier Full
      Stack Developer. I started learning web development in 2025 and joined the
      Chaicode cohort to gain deep, real-world skills.

    <h3>Learning Timeline</h3>

      <li>🕸️ Phase 0: Networking + Git (Completed)</li>
      <li>🕷️ Phase 1: HTML, CSS, and PRD (Ongoing)</li>
      <li>💻 Next: JavaScript and frontend projects</li>
      <li>🚀 Goal: Land a full-time developer job by early 2026</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Personal Note</h3>
    <p>
      I believe learning coding is not just about syntax, it’s about creating,
      solving, and evolving — every single day.
